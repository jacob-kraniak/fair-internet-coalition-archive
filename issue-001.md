We need to document the full technical stack that supported the Fair Internet Coalition website, surveys, communication, and outreach.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Create file `/tech-stack/overview.md`
- Include at minimum:
  - Website: WordPress (hosting provider if known, domain registrar)
  - Surveys & data viz: Google Forms + Looker Studio (include public dashboard links)
  - Collaboration & email: Google Workspace (note planned spin-down and migration plan)
  - Social platforms: List with handles (already in README, cross-link)
  - Other: Slack workspace, Patreon, Action Network profile
- Add a short "Revival / Migration Tips" section (e.g., how to export Forms data, alternatives to Google Workspace)
- Link to relevant files (e.g., Looker Studio URLs in initiatives/surveys.md)

**Why**: Makes the archive more useful for anyone trying to revive or understand the operational side.

**Estimated effort**: 30–45 minutes
