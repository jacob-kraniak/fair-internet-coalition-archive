# Revival / Handover Guide

Steps if someone wants to reactivate FIC:

1. **Domain & Website**:
   - Check renewal at registrar (likely Namecheap/GoDaddy—login via historical Workspace).
   - Export remaining WP content (Plugins > Export) or use HTTrack to mirror.

2. **Google Workspace**:
   - Already planned spin-down: Export all Drive/Forms/Looker before cancel.
   - Transfer Looker dashboards ownership or download PDFs/CSVs.

3. **Social Reactivation**:
   - X/Instagram/YouTube: Log in with historical creds, update bios/links.
   - Facebook: Reclaim page/groups if still admin; export content first.
   - Update links to point to revived site/repo.

4. **Legal/501(c)(3)**:
   - Check IRS status (still active? Use Guidestar/IRS search).
   - File any required annual forms if reviving.

5. **Surveys & Data**:
   - Reactivate Google Forms or migrate to new tool.
   - Use preserved Looker links/CSVs for baseline.

6. **Contacts**:
   - Reach repo owner (Jacob Kraniak) via GitHub or historical email for handoff.

Risks: Low recent engagement; potential domain/social loss if creds forgotten.
