      "description": "As we enter the Halloween weekend I would like to share my scary conversation with Optimum yesterday. \n\nMany of you are aware that price increases are coming to Optimum starting with the next bill. Yesterday I called Optimum to complain about pricing and request some form of abatement based on lousy service and poor speeds. \n\nAdditionally, I texted that when I signed up for service 2 years ago I was given the Price for Life Guarantee. Therefore there should be no changes in what I am paying even though it is still too much. \n\nI never actually got an answer to any of my questions about PFL  Instead the agent tried to talk me into a lesser package as an attempt to lower my bill. \n\nWhen I mentioned streaming with my own equipment she sent me a text that said \"you can try to do that but without our equipment and service it probably won't work well.\" I don't think these folks get it. \n\nBut here at FIC we are working hard to make sure that they face consequences. Next stop.... Retention department when I call to drop all but internet service.\n\n- Frank Kanter"
