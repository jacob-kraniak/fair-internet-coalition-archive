The proposal would impose a gross receipts tax on streaming services, which would essentially be a sales tax on streaming services. This means that the streaming services would have to pay the tax, which would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe proposal has been met with opposition from both consumers and streaming services. Critics of the tax argue that it could lead to an increase in prices for streaming services, which are already expensive. In addition, they argue that the tax could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, which could make streaming services unaffordable for some.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the proposal will be included in the final budget. If it is, streaming services could become more expensive for consumers. In the meantime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep an eye on the budget process to see how this proposal is handled."

I would love this company to be audited to find out how much they make annually on incorrect service charges that the common customer is unable to successfully challenge because of the inept customer service department that acts as a brick wall in front of actual results. When I experienced service interruptions, I was incorrectly accused of having flood damage in my apartment as the reason for the issue by the service technician. In reality, the issue was the pole my wires were connected to was overloaded and had damage. I had to take a week off of work (I work remotely) because they refused to send a technician out earlier than 5 days.\n\n When I went to cancel my service because I was moving, it was shut off a month early and then they tried to charge me with a new customer fee to reconnect me for $275.

On 15 August 2020 I cancelled internet, tv and phone service with Optimum, following a twelve-day outage of all services with no updates provided, no estimate of when service would be restored, and no reasonable offer of compensation when I spoke to the retention department. \nAfter cancelling, I immediately returned a cable card (the only company equipment I had) via a prepaid FedEx label printed from Optimum's website. I had confirmation from FedEx that this was delivered to Optimum on 19 August. I subsequently tried and failed to have Optimum remove a charge for this equipment. I messaged them, waited on hold for 80 minutes, and called again, all with no action. Four weeks after I returned the equipment I filed a complaint with the FCC, and subsequently had the charges removed.

My service was scheduled to be interuptted on 08/25 if the balance was unpaid.  I reached out to Optimum via chat to let them know I could pay the full balance on 08/31 and to please grant an extension until then. The agent told me they had extended it for me. \n\nCome to find out they lied to get me off the chat. My internet will be suspended at midnight and Optimum will not stand by what the agent told me, and I provided screenshot proof. Even after explaining that I work from home and losing service means my livelihood is in jeopardy, they still would not help. What's worse is the next agent told me they would grant a 5 day extension once the service is disconnected. 3 different agents said that to me. Come to find out because they split my past due balance into 2 seperate amounts, I have to pay one of them or I can't even get 5 days.  I assured them I can pay the full balance on 08/31 and just need a 6 day extension so that I can keep working.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent over 20 hours a week on the phone trying to get the service fixed for myself and my other neighbors that are stuck on Optimum for the past month and a half. This kind of cycle happens at least 3 to 4 times a year and has been going on since 2006"

This cannot be further from the truth. The fact that you recently switched to fiber is conclusive proof that Optibum has been scamming customers with false promises of \"enrichment\" fees and hidden rental fees. It is not mentioned that your organization has been battling a dozen lawsuits related to the misleading and overcomplicated billing practices"

Ever since I switched from Verizon many years ago (FIOS didn't exist back then), I've had more internet outages and service interruptions, constant short, random drops in my internet, and overall the customer service is unhelpful, and that's if you can actually reach them through their annoying automated phone system. Their cable and landline phone services are just as bad. What's worse is that they charge a ridiculous amount of money for terrible service."

Retaliating against me by CONSTANTLY raising my bill whenever I made a complaint, lowered my services and returning their equipment after buying my own! How does a person's bill get raised if they're using their own equipment and has the lowest \"package\" available? THEY also removed me from the Affordable Connectivity Program...meanwhile, their own information as well as ACP states I'm still enrolled!! Each time, I complain my bill is increased! I'm tired of paying this \"RANSOM!\" I've been going through this for DECADES, since they were CABLEVISION! This is the LAST STRAW...the amounts to follow have been for the past year, keeping in mind the different monthly fees, after I made complaints...ALL BECAUSE I CHANGED SERVICES AND BOUGHT MY OWN EQUIPMENT! They also took away a channel they promised to give me for free for 6 months!\nHere are my bills for one year from April 2021 last year to now May 2022 (in that order) $187.02, $113.40, $127.43, $86.91, $127.42, $127.47, $127.50, $177.50, $125.25. Clearly the fluctuations in my bills are obvious! Something needs to be done about this ABUSE!! I would have long ago gotten rid of Optimum but, my phone number and other things are attached to them and they surely take advantage of that fact! I'm seeking legal options!!\nFound Survey from: Twitter\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

We have NEVER had a choice of cable or internet service providers. Because of lack of competition they are charging us outrageous amount of money and they bundle everything as they please so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a way to reduce our costs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criminal. Can someone please look into this company before we all go bankrupt?  As you know we NEED to have internet if we want to survive Covid. Everything depends on the internet.  As far as cable I watch maybe 10 channels tops but I am forced to pay for packages I never use!  If you have a problem with service they charge you to come into your home to replace their own defective equipment!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m paying Altice more than my other utilities all together!

They cannot make changes to my account. They say there was an error. They barely speak English. New customers are offered faster service for less money, but me as a 10+ year customer I am not able to get those same rates. I also cannot switch to another competitor. I have Verizon for phone. If I try switching to their service, I am not able to get the new customer rates there either.

I am very much in the minority here, but I have had very little issues with Optimum since moving into my apartment. Went with Optimum as they were less expensive than Verison's offering. Locked into $55/month 500Mb synchronous Fiber, internet only, and have little issue with speed or reliability. One notable outage, but it lasted all of 10 minutes in the middle of the night.\n\nAs a note, I work doing virtual events, broadcasting, and live production. I often run shows from my home office, and are dependent on my internet to be reliable. While I do have plenty of backups for those productions should my home internet go down, they have yet to be needed.\nFound Survey from: Reddit - /r/longisland\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

My wifi worked fine for the first year and then suddenly I could not get wifi to my bedroom. For context I live in a small apartment with one other person. When we called we had to wait over an hour and they claimed the reason we did not have wifi was because we had too many devices. To solve the problem they wanted us to get a more expensive plan. We have had the same amount of devices as the previous year\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we purchased a wifi extender which they said would not solve the problem and now I have wifi in my bedroom again.\nFound Survey from: Reddit - /r/longisland\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

The service is the worst I've ever seen. The internet goes down multiple times a week (and multiple times a day is not unusual) for 5+ minutes at a time. The worst was an inexplicable 30+ minute outage in the middle of the workday. We're looking to buy a house now and whether an internet provider besides Optimum is available is a major factor.\nFound Survey from: Reddit - /r/longisland\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

Returned router to use my own and coincidentally my next bill had one of my 'discounts' removed.  Returning a router doesn't guarantee they'll remove the charge.  Had to switch back to one of their's b/c mine was problematic.  When I returned the 2nd one they never credited my account.  They then claimed to have no record of my return and would have to 'look for it'.  I shared my receipt and they told me i'd get a credit in 2-5 business days.  Been down that road before - the credit is never shown anywhere and they only give it to you on the next bill.  If you don't catch it, you need to contact them and wait another month as they won't credit the current bill.  IMPOSSIBLE to port out an Optimum voice number - everyone you talk to on chat or customer service by voice gives you a different answer.  Also the only vendor I've ever worked with where I a. need to contact them to negotiate for a fair price, every year b. have to talk to a 'retention specialist' to cancel a service.  I could go on...\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

I called to see why some of the channels I was paying for would work on the cable box but not on their corresponding online apps while using my Altice login.  When they couldnt figure it out I told them to cancel the package I was signed up.  The woman on the phone told me if I cancelled my cable package I could never get it again.  When I asked for a supervisor he got on the phone and tried to fix things, but he only made it worse.  He couldnt even get the channels to come up on my cable box anymore, let alone the apps.  \n\nAnother time I called their customer support because our internet wasnt working.  They factory reset my Altice modem/router and I still couldnt login so they said they would send a tech out.  When I finally figured out what the problem was for myself, it was that they had neglected to tell me that factory resetting the router would reset the password.  So I had been using the wrong password to try to login. \n\nThey are completely, and utterly incompetent for such a large company.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

After a year of technicians coming by our house to \"fix\" the internet issues we were having, it took the FCC to get in contact with the hire ups of Optimum. After a suppose fix in August of 2021, they only compensated us for 1 month bill (we were still paying full price with the issues we were having). Now October of 2021, the internet issues were happening again. After calling customer service, it's like you never get someone who is stationed or understands what they're doing. I feel Optimum is aware of this issue considering that's live in a rural area, there won't be any other service providers to switch to. The pricing permonth for 400 download and 40 upload is very overpriced. I see optimum ads where they advertise $40 a month for the same speeds but when it comes to entering the area for my location, the price is $100+. So I have a sense of feel it's false advertising.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

I'm not a professional streamer, not trying to be. I just like to have fun and have video of myself gaming because my friends and I all game together. I was on optimum internet because that's what my housemate had when I moved in.\n\nI made it maybe a week before my internet started absolutely tanking. I'm talking 90% dropped frames, and complete disconnection multiple times a night. \n\nSo I speed checked my internet using multiple different speed check sites. All of them came back between 100 Mbps down 0.1 and 0.5mbps up, So I call Optimum customer service. They have me unplug and replug everything, they do whatever tests they do on their end, and they tell me that the problem is my modem. I severely doubt that the problem is the modem but I have a gut feeling I'm about to get into a fight with them and I would just rather remove any excuses they have before it starts.\n\nSo I go down to the optimum store. I switch out the modem, and while I'm there I ask the customer service representative what the speed on the account is supposed to be, as she has the account information pulled up. She tells me that the speed is supposed to be 100 down and 25 up. \n\nI was a little surprised, I'm a very tech oriented person and I know that Verizon is in the area and their base plan is 200 megabits per second. However, my housemate is an older gentleman and not very tech savvy. He also doesn't use the internet for anything intensive, just checking email and using zoom, So I figure he must be on a super cheap plan because that's what works for him. On the way home I figured I would simply ask him how much he was paying for internet and then offer to have him tack a few bucks onto my rent to upgrade to the plan that would give me sufficient upload speeds.\n\nSo I arrive home, I install the router. Same problem, 100 down 0.1 up. I then ask my housemate how much he's paying for internet and he hands me his optimum bill.  It is at this moment that I discover that for a hundred down and 25 up, of which they are only providing 0.1 up, they are charging him $89.99 a month plus a $9.99 modem rental fee, effectively $100/month.\n\nNow I have moved beyond being annoyed by not being able to stream, to being righteously angry at the fact that they are effectively robbing My housemate because they understand that he doesn't understand how much internet should cost.\n\nI call customer service again. I'm mad but I don't lose my cool. I informed them that I have looked at the front page of their website And they are offering new customers gigabit internet at $49 a month. I explain to them what they have been doing, and I inform them that they're going to give us that price. They informed me that that price is only for new customers. I inform them back that if that's the case we will simply go be new customers at Verizon. They then immediately transfer me up the chain to a representative who says that while they're happy to give me the new price they don't actually have fiber optic gigabit internet where I live they simply have cable gigabit internet which only has a 50 megabits per second upload speed. This does not solve my problem because doubling my upload speed simply means I will be going from 0.1 up to 0.2 up which is still unusable for streaming. I also point out to them that they offer plans that are triple the speed of the plan my housemate has for $29 a month. There is no world in which he should be paying $89 a month for 100 down. I could not even find the plan listed on their website.\n\nAt this point they have been giving me such a runaround, including trying to explain to me that for some reason in the age of covid where everybody is using zoom to communicate that they have their network configured to be only using 10% of its power for upload speeds, that I'm convinced they are lying to me. I simply hang up, I do not even say anything, the representative is mid sentence and I just hang up. I call back probably 20 minutes later and pretend to be the house next door to a completely different representative. It turns out they actually do not have fiber optic in my area.\n\nMy housemate is a little sketchy about switching, he doesn't like to change things up and I get it because he's not super tech savvy. However at this point I contact Verizon and discover that if I bundle the internet that we want with my phone bill it is actually not 89 a month, it's 55 a month, which I can simply afford by myself and my housemate says he's fine with me getting installed because it doesn't cost him anything. I scheduled the internet installation.\n\nIn the Days between that and the new internet getting installed, zoom itself becomes utterly unusable to my housemate. This makes me believe that I was being throttled for streaming, because he's never had this issue before and suddenly after I started streaming and raised a stink about the upload speed, the upload speed has gotten so bad that he is having issues holding zoom meetings.\n\nI get the FiOS internet installed. I've been using it ever since then, I have had a exact total of zero dropped frames since the day it was installed. The slowest my upload speed is ever gotten during peak is 300 megabits per second. My housemate switched on to it and canceled his optimum.\n\nThis is why I don't use Optimum, because as far as I'm concerned they exploited and ripped off my elderly housemate because they could. As far as I'm concerned they owe every penny he paid over $30 a month for the last 5 years back.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

It's really Optimum (Altice) or nothing. People have been saying for years that FIOS is coming to the area but my street hasn't seen it. So we are stuck with what we got. No options in pricing or customer satisfaction. Have a bad experience with the ISP? Tough, you're with them for life.

My speeds would jump up and be really good but the modem/router kept rebooting several times a day. After a week of calling every day and being on the phone for many hours- when I could actually get a person because the voice response system is horrible - I was told that it was the modem/router and that my \u00e2\u0080\u009csetup\u00e2\u0080\u009d could not handle the 1 gig and suggested I move back to the 400 plan. I did this change and now still how issues. I did not have this issue before I switched to 1 gig - I just wanted faster speeds because I work from home. They suggested a technician come out to my house, at a cost, but I do not need a technician, it is obviously an issue with their services. This is so incredibly frustrating and I feel trapped with this service. There is no accountability. It is no longer a luxury to have internet service but a necessity.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

Internet and cable connections all of a sudden has had intermittent disconnects.  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anyone on the phone for help.  When you do,  reps are useless and have no real solution to fix the problem.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same response: restart modem, restart router.  Modem changed 3 times.  Other times I would be on hold for about an hour before they hang up/disconnect.   Connection speed we subscribed/paid for is not what we are getting.   Got so fed up with the poor cable quality that we dropped the cable & telephone service but unfortunately have to keep the internet service due to the job.  If we had another competitive choice for a internet service provider, we would absolutely drop Optimum/Altice.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

I had no issues with their service until that point. Then the slowdowns started. I called tech support after restarting everything, and the tech said it's probably my modem (which was just replaced within the year), and they wanted to send a tech out. I can't afford an $80 tech visit if (when) they decide it's my modem that's bad (even though I know it's not). This is a parasite of a company. They only try to sell you a tech call or modem rental.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

Service was terrible and they refused to adequately fix an issue that affected me for almost my entire time with them. \n\nWorse than the service was the customer support. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to speak with a representative. The phone service puts you on an automated loop. The web chat barely functions and when it does the person on the other side refuses to do anything except call in. \n\nNow they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re charging me a bill for unreturned equipment, which was returned 3 months ago. When asked they said they were sorry for the confusion and they would handle it. And now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting calls from a collection agency for that same equipment?  So I reach out to have it sorted and they refuse to speak to me.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

If you cancel in a billung cycle they will charge you for the rest of the month. I did not know this information and was not told by the retention rep at time of cancellation. I cancelled on May 11th, disconnected their equipment and I am still getting charged until June 9th for a service I am not using. The retention reps would not let me cancel. They kept coming back with different prices, were rude and insulting. I then had reps call me a few days later to try and get me back as a customer. I called a supervisor to cancel this months payment but she refused stating company policy. I wrote a Twitter review and optimum responded saying that my paying this bill for no service is better then paying a cancel contract fee....I haven't had a contract with them in 3 years.\n\n#OptimumSurvey #OptimumComplaints #AlticeSurvey #AlticeComplaints #SuddenlinkSurvey #SuddenlinkComplaints #canceloptimum #cancelsuddenlink #alticeiscancelled"

Our bill is 250 a month. After 2 1/2 hours in a chat with them, they said it can't be lowered? This account is in my mother's name, she's 90! \nWe could buy a modem but we have to rent their cable convertor. \nThere is no other company available either. \nOur cable was out for a long period of time, probably 10 days. My mother had no phone if she needed help!  I called numerous times, and contacted them online. We did not get a refund for that time. They claimed I didn't contact them. \nThen the service goes out here and there. No reason, they have no explanation. \nThe only reason we still have this, is it will be difficult for my mom to navigate the firestick, but we are working on that. \nI'd never recommend this service to anyone. Awful, and they are thieves. \nPlease do something about them!"

I continue to experience dropped internet at 5 min intervals and it has been this way for 8 years. I have never been successful at getting an outside technician to fix the lines. The issue is 100% on Optimums end but I have no choice to stick with them. There are no other available ISP's in my area.  \n\nHere is a review I left for them on 6/23/20\n\nWOW, Just wow. I cant believe you guys can run a business like this and not be shut down. I am reporting this to consumer affairs as well (but I don't think you care). I called your customer service line for the Long Island New York area 631-393-0636 on Tuesday June 23rd 2020 9:47 AM to inquire about my billing statement. I was unhappy that I am paying for 400 mbps but NEVER get the speeds I pay for after running several internet tests. I wanted to lower my bill because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably a little overkill for the 400 mbps anyway so I inquired about the 200 mpbs. After thoroughly searching online for pricing I found that new customers will pay half of that price and are qualified for *life time pricing locked in. I ask why are new customers paying less for lifetime and I have been loyal for over 10 years....the answer I received was \"were working on it\". Frustrated at this point I flat out said I wanted to cancel my service...this is where it went off the rails. The woman flat out refused to cancel my service. I asked to speak with a manager and she said \"he was busy\". I asked to be transferred to the Retention Department and she said \"they only deal with cancellations and you cannot cancel until your next billing cycle on July 7th\". I said that's fine, I want to speak with them regarding scheduling a cancel date....she refused. Flat out said NO for over 15 mins. She then made an excuse that her transfer button was broken. I stayed on the phone with her for over 45 mins refusing to give up until I spoke to someone but had no success. I asked over and over again to be transferred, to speak with anyone and she absolutely flat out refused. I wanted her name...she said no. I wanted a confirmation number so I had a record of my billing changes...she said no. After asking to be transferred to someone else who can help (all of sudden her transfer works) I was hung up on. Absolutely awful, disrespectful, and sad customer service you guys have. I am actually kind of shocked that you guys haven't been featured on the news regarding your practices."

However, Optimum steered senior citizen customer to Altice which in turn provided an unfavorable cellular contract with very poor customer service. Customer service has misguided our efforts. In addition, Altice opened an account by misguiding one senior citizen to use their spouse's identity information. We are now in the process of spending dozens of hours trying to nullify the agreement with Altice. We have also complained to the NY Attorney General and expect to get satisfaction through our own negotiations and our outreach to law enforcement."

I would consider switching from Optimum depending on cost, and the performance record of an alternate provider.

However, I admit it wasn't easy."

Optimum has no reason to serve our community with the best service possible because they have no competition.

They have good speeds and reliability. There was one issue where I had to go back and forth with them just to figure out why I was having latency issues. That took several months, but they eventually had someone come in and fixed it (it was a wiring issue in the main panel). Speeds are good now.\n\nNow what I don't like about Optimum are their \"promotional pricing,\" which is pretty much the normal price you'd pay if you were to have Verizon FiOS. I'll be moving soon to an area WITHOUT FiOS, so this will be a problem as I'll have no leverage if I wanted to keep promotional pricing with Optimum (they'll probably just laugh at my attempts to cancel).\n\nWould I recommend them to family and friends? Sure, absolutely, if for speed and reliability (as long as nothing's wrong). But I'd tell them to be wary of Optimum's sudden price increases due to their very expensive \"original pricing.\" I'd tell them \"attempt to cancel your service once you've had nearly a year of service to see if they'll keep your promotional pricing.\" It's a very stressful process to undergo and even think about. Having your Internet fees go up by $120 all of a sudden is not good, especially if Optimum's the only Internet provider in a particular area."

You cannot get a live person on the phone for service issues. You have to threaten to leave before getting any resolution.  Their automated phone system and chat contact is extremely frustrating to get through, and almost impossible for an elderly or visually impaired person.  They illegally terminated my disabled elderly parents service while they were on Seasonal mode and away in Florida.  They came home to no phones, TV or internet,  even though they called 4 days prior to resolve a billing issue that was due to postal delays.  They had to go in person to straighten it out the next day,  because you cannot get someone on the phone! They STILL do not have phone service,  because the technical support id incompetent. I am completely disgusted with this company and will look for other options."

Tried switching to Altice and it took 4 techs to try and make the switch.  They said the issue was with our computer , cable connections were changed and then that they couldn't provision it.  When the last tech was here, we told him if he can't fix things to leave, he snuck out to his truck and left once again with things not working properly.  It  took  a call to Albany, consumer protection for them to call back and try fixing our problems.  Now, there are still unresolved issues, the cable box cover flew away and they have not come to replace it and the cable coming out of it and going into the ground was not put in properly and is a safety concern.....when you call, all they want to know is if you want to increase your service!  They need some competition !"

While healthcare and essential workers are risking their lives to keep society afloat, Optimum is taking advantage of a horrific situation to make a buck. They've also required citizens to actively tell them when a hub is down and there's no internet access - as a company that charges an obscene price monthly, shouldn't they be more on top of and take charge of the upkeep of the internet hubs in busy neighborhoods?"

The speeds they promise are only true a fraction of the time, most of the time the speeds are much lower, and/or intermittently lower at the times the most people are on.  They have replaced every wire and hardware from the street to my house and inside my house and the speeds still remain highly unreliable.  I do much of my work from home, and I also remote connect to my home PC from work and in both cases this has affected my work ability, in particular their upload speeds are nowhere near as promised and means I cannot remote into my PC from work for the past couple of years. Their customer service is a joke, you wait hours on the phone to get to a representative that follows the same exact troubleshooting list that virtually never resolves the issues.  The last tech I had over my house didn't wear a mask and it was during the pandemic, and invited himself to pee all over my toilet without asking, was overall very rude and did not complete the job.  I can't say Optimum was ever any good, but in the past few years they have dramatically nose dived in all aspects.  Finally, it really should be illegal for towns to form these little cartels of exclusivity where only one cable provider is allowed to provide service.  Don't we avoid monopolies in business for just this reason?  If there were ever a case to be made for limiting monopolies because competition breeds a better product then a company like Optimum is definitely the best case."

Originally Optimum, it was reasonably good technically, speeds, stability, helpful and knowledgable tech support. They have always used dubious smart businesses practices to hike the bill at every opportunity when the customer is not on top of it, necessitating vigilance of bills and frequent complaints to get it adjusted. Then Altice took over. Now it feel like we're in a third world country territory. The quality of tech support has plummeted to appalling, not only in time to resolve issues (days go by on phone calls and waiting for a tech to show up), but also in the competence of the engineers. Below supervisor level, many have no clue what theiy are doing and just bluff it out, so one tech visit can turn into 3, each time with new equipment installed, because that's how they train them, so from a business perspective this is not cost effective for anyone! It got so bad over the last year or so, I contracted for a 2 year LTE Verizon Mifi plan, simply to be able to maintain my business as a short term measure to cover their frequent service interruptions. It's a monopoly. They know it. We know it and given that Internet service is now an essential service, vital to survival, no less important than say fuel for heating, some form of regulatory authority needs to take them over and start operating as a not-for-profit utility company."

I have been told MULTIPLE times that they have found an issue and are working to fix it, but it will take MONTHS sometimes to fix said issue.  The best part is it's not the Download I'm experiencing issues with, its Upload.  I stream on Twitch.tv and frequently, at least 4 or 5 or 6 times a year there will be spans of a Month or two where I just can't consistently stream because Optimum is providing the worst service I've ever experienced, and it just gets worse and worse every time an issue shows up.  But I WILL say that every now and again my internet will suddenly one day be working fine and be fine for a few weeks, and I'll experience no issues, until the cycle repeats itself."

No loyalty discount since Dolans sold, ridiculous lies about service issues( non existant in the home) horrible cs, always trying to upsell,  always raising prices, but less and less content. Servicemen dont always show up or if they do its w/o. PPE. Problems nwver fixed . Complain to BPU & they have Corporate call and lie saying you need to pay for a service call. Even if you dont. Internet down always the same times due to bandwidth and old wiring They say you need a,service call in a recording BUT IT THEN FIXES ITSELF MIRACULOUSLY! You call and the wait is forever to get help Hrs! But no outcome, you need a repairman. Check social media its everywhere! OUTAGES. They take your money, give no credit, you have no service. They lie. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A LEMON LAW.Even the CEO said cable is done.If you ask them to reboot your service if they even will, you get your wifi back,  no service call.  They are getting away with the same thing they got sues for in Europe."

Additionally, if I were to have an intermittent problem, which happens but not constant, I would have to pay the technician to come to the house, to repair their equipment, which is at fault. Please keep in mind, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an intermittent problem, such as internet speed or faults. One day its fine the next it slower then traffic on the lie during rush hour. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the speed i pay for. They are always trying to scam you into paying more for something. It really is disgusting. I have no alternatives. Other then getting into a 2 yr satellite contract 1. For tv, another for internet. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve filed a complaint with the fcc, no response. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve called the town, and was given a silly reason.  Seems many towns and areas are being bribed by optimum.

Two technicians have come out in the past year and replaced the main lines to the house and the main cable box. The internet got slightly better in terms of speed (when it isn't dropping) but the cable is constantly pixelating and the phone often has no dial tone. Multiple technicians have come and tried to repair the problem over the years. They all say that someone has to come and fix a specific issue in the basement (something about a booster) but they never submit the ticket and the next technician is always unprepared for the real issue, gets frustrated, and slaps a band aid on the issue for another few weeks. Wash, rinse, repeat. We are so done and ready to switch to Fios which is also available in the area."
