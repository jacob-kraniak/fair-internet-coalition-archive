# Facebook Groups Archive

This file summarizes FIC's group-related activity from the Facebook export JSONs. FIC was affiliated with/owned several groups focused on ISP complaints and advocacy (e.g., against Optimum/Altice). Raw JSONs migrated to `/resources/social/facebook/raw/` (or subdirs)—review for any overlooked PII before public commit. Data is historical (up to ~2025 based on timestamps); groups may be dormant now.
