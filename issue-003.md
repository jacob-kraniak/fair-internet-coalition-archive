Add standard repo files to make collaboration and revival easier.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md (root level) with:
  - How to contribute (fork → edit in Obsidian → PR)
  - Guidelines (accuracy, no PII, Markdown best practices)
  - How to open issues/PRs
- Create `/current-status/revival-guide.md` with:
  - Domain renewal steps
  - Google Workspace export/migration checklist
  - Social reactivation notes
  - Legal/501(c)(3) status check
  - Contact info for repo owner
  - Risks (dormancy, credential loss)
- Link both files from README

**Why**: Lowers barrier for anyone picking up the project later.
