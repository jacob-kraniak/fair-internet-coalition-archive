GitHub Wiki is currently disabled. Enabling it would allow longer-form documentation without cluttering the repo.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Go to repo Settings → Features → Enable Wiki
- Create at least two starter pages:
  - Home: Overview of archive purpose + link to README
  - Timeline: Chronological milestones (2019 founding → 2024 dormancy)
- Optionally add sidebar navigation

**Why**: Separates extended narrative/docs from repo files.

**Estimated effort**: 15–20 minutes
**Assignee**: @jacob-kraniak
**Priority**: Medium-low (can defer)
