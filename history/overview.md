# Fair Internet Coalition – Historical Overview

## Founding & Evolution
- Started ~2019 as a consumer advocacy effort against broadband monopolies in the Tri-State (NY/NJ/CT), with heavy focus on Long Island's Optimum/Altice dominance.
- Evolved into formal nonprofit: 501(c)(3) status confirmed July 31, 2022 (announced in surprise during a meeting by Frank Kanter).
- Peak activity: 2021–2022 (survey launches, PSC testimony, website updates, community presentations like Centereach Civic Assoc. 2021).
- Disbanded/moved on ~2024; last public update April 2023.

## Key Milestones
- **2021**: Beta surveys, NJBPU hearing results, meetings with legislators (e.g., Senator Michelle Hinchey), Starlink pre-order coverage notes.
- **2022**: 501(c)(3) approval (July), OCG fiber updates, Optimum survey hits 745 responses (Sep), OCG v. Verizon press release (Dec).
- **2023**: Brookhaven OCG license vote push (Mar), Optimum Survey Bot ends on Twitter due to API changes (Apr – final post).

## Team (from available public info)
- Jacob Kraniak: Founder, primary contact/administrative director.
- Frank Kanter: Key member (reported 501c3 status, presented at events).
- Others: Mentions of Alec Foster (email), Kathen Cowan (treasurer in PSC refs), small volunteer group via meetings/Slack.

Goal was education, data collection, and support for competitive ISPs (explicitly NOT promoting incumbents like Spectrum, Verizon Fios, Comcast).
