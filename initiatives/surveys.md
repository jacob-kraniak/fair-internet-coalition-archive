# ISP Satisfaction Surveys Initiative

## Purpose
Collect consumer feedback on reliability, affordability, transparency to support advocacy and highlight gaps in incumbent providers (focus: Optimum/Altice in Long Island/Tri-State).

## Implementation
- Hosted on WordPress with provider-specific links (e.g., /isp-satisfaction-surveys/altice-survey, /xfinity-comcast-survey).
- Used Google Forms (required Google login for validation to prevent duplicates/fakes).
- Promoted via site, Reddit (r/OPTIMUM – 400+ responses early), Facebook groups (Optimum/Altice Dilemmas – FIC admins), X bot (ended 2023).

## Known Stats
- Optimum survey: 745 total submissions by Sep 2022 (~18 months run).
- No public raw data or final reports on site; check private repo for any exports.
