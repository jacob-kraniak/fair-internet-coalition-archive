The README references /resources/ but the folder is empty or not fully populated.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Create folder `/resources/`
- Create subfolders:
  - `/resources/media/` → for screenshots, event photos, profile pictures, etc.
  - `/resources/social/` → for platform-specific summaries
  - `/resources/social/facebook/` → move or link facebook-archive.md, posts-archive.md, groups-archive.md, etc.
- Upload at least 5–10 example images (e.g., profile picture evolution, Brookhaven meeting photo, survey dashboard screenshots)
- Create `/resources/social/facebook/README.md` that indexes all FB-related MD files
- Add alt text to images and brief captions

**Why**: Centralizes visual and external assets; improves handover value.

**Estimated effort**: 45–60 minutes (mostly uploads & organization)
